### Case Study: Student Grade Management System

**Scenario:**
You are tasked with developing a simple grade management system for a school. The system needs to manage student records, calculate their average grades, and determine whether each student has passed or failed based on specific criteria.

### Requirements:

1. **Student Data:**
   - Each student has a name, a list of grades for different subjects, and an overall average grade.
   - You need to store data for three students.

2. **Grade Calculation:**
   - Calculate the average grade for each student based on their grades in different subjects.

3. **Pass/Fail Criteria:**
   - A student passes if their average grade is 50 or above. Otherwise, they fail.

4. **Grade Categorization:**
   - Categorize the students based on their average grade:
     - 90 and above: Excellent
     - 75 to 89: Good
     - 50 to 74: Average
     - Below 50: Fail

5. **Reporting:**
   - Print a report for each student showing their name, average grade, and whether they passed or failed.
   - Include their grade category in the report.

6. **Scope:**
   - Use both global and local variables where appropriate.
   - Implement at least one function to calculate the average grade.
   - Utilize loops to handle multiple students and conditional statements to determine the pass/fail status and grade category.

**Hint:**
- Consider using arrays to store the list of grades for each student.
- Think about how to structure the loop to process each studentâ€™s data.

### Deliverables:
- Write JavaScript code to implement the above requirements.
- Ensure that the code is organized, with comments explaining each section.
