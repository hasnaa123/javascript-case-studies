Case Study: Room Reservation Workflow
Problem Statement:
You are designing a system that allows customers to reserve a room at a hotel. The system performs the following tasks in sequence:

Step 1: Check if a room is available for the requested type and dates.
Step 2: Save the customerâ€™s booking details if a room is available.
Step 3: Process the payment for the reservation.
Step 4: Send a confirmation message to the customer.

Steps to Implement:
1. **Step 1**: Create a function checkRoomAvailability(roomType, checkInDate, checkOutDate) to simulate checking the room availability.
2. **Step 2**: Create a function storeBookingDetails(customerDetails, bookingDetails) to simulate storing the booking details in a database.
3. **Step 3**: Create a function processPayment(paymentDetails) to simulate processing the payment.
4. **Step 4**: Create a function sendConfirmationEmail(customerEmail, bookingDetails) to simulate sending the confirmation email to the customer.
